<h2>Haskell simple Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>This project is a home assignment for Programming Languages course in my
university.</p>
<h3>Aim</h3>
<p>The aim of the project is to build simple virtual machine that is capable
of running simple functions such as load values into stack,
do some arithmetics with loaded values, perhaps execute statements.
Project is written in Haskell.</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>This project only covers requirements given in assignment.</p>

<p><i>P.S This is initial README.md. Will be updated as project grows(hopefully).</i></p>
